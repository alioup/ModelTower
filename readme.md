#Light the Tower

A favorite UT tradition is lighting the tower organge to celebrate the accomplishments of longhorns. This model tower will be either a 3dprinted model of of clear material or lazer etched into acrylic and have orange LEDs inside. An attached microcontroller will scarpe whyisthetowerorange.com to check if the actual UT tower is orange and accordingly light up the small model version. This will be a way to celebrate longhorn accomplishments and decorate our mantle.  \m/ Hook 'em!

The current main challange is to decide how to wire the microcontroller to run continiously on a battery. I am planning to use a raspberry pi but am concerned that it will consume too much power.
